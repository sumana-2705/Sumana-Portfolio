                <br>
                <p>Designed and implemented a high-performance vehicle detection system using the YOLOv5 deep learning model, pre-trained on a dataset of 2,704 traffic scenario images. The system achieved a remarkable 98% detection accuracy by integrating OpenCV for real-time image preprocessing and vehicle recognition. Leveraging transfer learning, the model was fine-tuned to enhance training efficiency and detection precision, making it highly optimized for real-world traffic environments. This project showcases expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and real-time application development for intelligent transportation systems.

                <p>Engineered an advanced NLP model to classify abstract sentences into their respective roles, such as objectives, methods, and results, facilitating researchers in efficiently skimming through literature and focusing on relevant sections. Experimented with five diverse modeling approaches, including a 1D Convolutional model, a Naive Bayes model with pretrained embeddings, a convolutional model with character embeddings, and a hybrid embedding layer combining pretrained token and character embeddings.

                <br>
                <p>A Multiple Regression model was developed to predict the Student Performance Index using key factors such as Hours Studied, Previous Scores, Sleep Hours, and Number of Practice Papers. By employing Multiple Variable Linear Regression techniques, the model effectively learned the relationships between these features and the performance metric. The model achieved impressive results with training, cross-validation, and test costs of 220.20, 230.12, and 226.96 respectively, significantly outperforming the benchmark of 368.51.
